From the val-ley, they say you are go-ing,
Then come sit here a-while ere you leave us,
        C                          G7
You are chang-ing your range for a while,
Do not has--ten   to   bid    us a- dieu,
          C                      F
So   you  say you are wear-y and tired,
Come back soon to the Red Ri-ver valley,
         G7                           C
We shall miss your dear face and your smile.
And the   cow-boy  who loves you  so  true.
