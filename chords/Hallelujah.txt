C                
I've heard there was
Am
A secret chord
C
That David played, and
Am
It pleased the Lord
F
But you don't really care
              C  G7
For music, do you?
C
It goes like this:
F               G
The fourth, the fifth
Am                  G
The minor fall, the major lift
G
The baffled king
Em             Am
Composing Hallelujah 
F           C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
F           C    G7 C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 

Your faith was strong
But you needed proof
You saw her bathing
On the roof
Her beauty and the
Moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne
And she cut your hair
And from your lips
She drew the Hallelujah 

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 

Maybe I've been here before
I know this room
I've walked this floor
I used to live alone
Before I knew you
I've seen your flag
On the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and
It's a broken Hallelujah 

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 

There was a time
You let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show
It to me, do you?
I remember when
I moved in, you
Your holy dark
Was moving too
And every breath we drew
Was Hallelujah 

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 

Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever
Learned from love
Was how to shoot
At someone
Who outdrew you
It's not a cry
You can hear at night
It's not somebody
Who's seen the light
It's a cold and
It's a broken Hallelujah 

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah 

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
